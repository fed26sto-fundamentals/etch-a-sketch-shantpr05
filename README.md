# Project: Etch-a-Sketch


[TOC]

## Introduction

This project is a dynamic, interactive grid sketchpad built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to create a customizable grid where each cell changes color as the mouse hovers over it, similar to a pixel art tool.

## Features

- A **16x16 grid** is created by default.
- The grid cells change color when hovered over.
- Users can **resize** the grid by clicking a button and entering a new grid size (up to a maximum of 100x100).
- The grid resizes dynamically while maintaining the same total width and height (960x960px).
- Cells are colored randomly when hovered over, and you can progressively darken cells using a custom opacity effect.
  
## Extra Features (Optional)

- Progressive darkening of squares upon each interaction.
- Random RGB colors applied on hover.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS (Flexbox)**: For styling the grid and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For generating the grid dynamically, handling user interaction, and applying hover effects.
